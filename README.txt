For this program I worked on an overlevel algorithm with Michael Sit, but we have different coding styles so decided to do seperate programs to fit our style. The driver for the heap is supposed to test every function of the heap ADT to make sure that they work at every level. The sortPrint file is supposed to show two unordered arrays and then sort them using the insertionSort and heapSort methods. The sortComp file is supposed to take in a file and do both heapSort and insertionSort on the integers and it clocks the CPU run time of both algorithms.
